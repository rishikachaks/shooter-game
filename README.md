# Shooter Game

A scrolling-shooter game made with Python 3.


## Description

This project includes main.py, which is the main game that can be played. It also includes leveleditor.py, which is what I created to design all three levels. The sprites as well as csv files for the levels are included as well. To play the game, simply use A and D to move left and right, W to jump, and space to shoot bullets.
